  - `Ctrl+Shift+L` - Toggle logging
- **🔧 Window.devUtils** - Access development tools from browser console

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **🛡️ Try-catch blocks** around all async operations
- **📢 User-friendly error messages** with technical logging
- **🔄 Graceful degradation** when features are unavailable
- **🐛 Better debugging** with detailed error context

### 6. **Code Quality Improvements**

- **📈 Performance monitoring** for development

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Improvements
```typescript
// Enhanced hook with comprehensive functionality
export const useScheduleFromConvex = (date: string) => {
  // Real-time queries with proper error handling
  const scheduleItems = useQuery(api.scheduleItems.getScheduleItems, {
    userId: MOCK_USER_ID,
    date,
  });

  // CRUD operations with logging and error handling
  const addScheduleItem = async (item) => {
    console.log('🔄 Adding schedule item:', item.title);
    try {
      const result = await createScheduleItem(item);
      console.log('✅ Successfully added schedule item:', result);
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('❌ Error adding schedule item:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  };

  // Import/Export functionality
  const exportSchedule = () => { /* JSON export with metadata */ };
  const importSchedule = async (jsonString) => { /* JSON import with validation */ };
  const clearSchedule = async () => { /* Clear all items */ };
  
  return {
    scheduleItems,
    addScheduleItem,
    // ... all other functions
  };
};
```

### Component Enhancements
```typescript
/**
 * ScheduleList Component
 * 
 * The main schedule management component that provides:
 * - Display of schedule items in chronological order
 * - Add/Edit/Delete functionality with inline forms
 * - Real-time synchronization with Convex database
 * - Subtask management for each schedule item
 * - Mobile-responsive design
 */
export const ScheduleList = forwardRef<any, ScheduleListProps>(({
  schedule,
  completionStatus,
  // ... other props
}, ref) => {
  // Comprehensive state management with proper TypeScript types
  // Error handling for all operations
  // Performance optimizations
  // Developer-friendly logging
});
```

### Development Utilities
```typescript
// Available globally in development mode
window.devUtils = {
  log: devLog,      // Enhanced logging utilities
  perf: devPerf,    // Performance monitoring
  state: devState,  // State inspection
  api: devAPI,      // API debugging
  data: devData,    // Test data generation
  test: devTest,    // Testing utilities
  env: devEnv       // Environment validation
};
```
