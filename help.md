# Integration of Convex and Clerk into FocusFlow

This document outlines the steps necessary to integrate Convex and Clerk into your existing React application.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, you need to install the required packages for Convex and Clerk. Run the following command in your project directory:

npm install convex clerk

## Step 2: Set Up Clerk

1. **Create a Clerk Account**: Go to the [Clerk website](https://clerk.dev/) and create an account.

2. **Create a New Application**: Once logged in, create a new application in the Clerk dashboard.

3. **Get API Keys**: After creating the application, you will receive API keys. Note these down as you will need them for configuration.

4. **Add Clerk Provider**: In your `src/App.tsx`, wrap your application with the `ClerkProvider`. Import the necessary components:

   ```tsx
   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

   const clerkFrontendApi = 'YOUR_CLERK_FRONTEND_API';

   function App() {
       return (
           <ClerkProvider frontendApi={clerkFrontendApi}>
               {/* Your existing app components */}
           </ClerkProvider>
       );
   }
   ```

## Step 3: Set Up Convex

1. **Create a Convex Account**: Go to the [Convex website](https://convex.dev/) and create an account.

2. **Create a New Project**: After logging in, create a new project in the Convex dashboard.

3. **Get API Keys**: Note down the API keys provided for your project.

4. **Initialize Convex**: In your project directory, run the following command to initialize Convex:

   ```bash
   npx convex init
   ```

5. **Add Convex Provider**: In your `src/App.tsx`, wrap your application with the `ConvexProvider`. Import the necessary components:

   ```tsx
   import { ConvexProvider } from 'convex/react';

   const convexUrl = 'YOUR_CONVEX_URL';

   function App() {
       return (
           <ClerkProvider frontendApi={clerkFrontendApi}>
               <ConvexProvider url={convexUrl}>
                   {/* Your existing app components */}
               </ConvexProvider>
           </ClerkProvider>
       );
   }
   ```

## Step 4: Implement Authentication

1. **Add Sign In/Sign Up Components**: Use Clerk's pre-built components for authentication. For example, you can add a sign-in button in your `Header.tsx`:

   ```tsx
   import { SignIn } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

   const Header = () => {
       return (
           <header>
               <SignIn />
           </header>
       );
   };
   ```

## Step 5: Use Convex in Your Application

1. **Create Convex Functions**: In your Convex project directory, create functions that interact with your backend. For example, create a function to fetch user data.

2. **Call Convex Functions**: In your components, use the Convex hooks to call your functions. For example:

   ```tsx
   import { useQuery } from 'convex/react';

   const MyComponent = () => {
       const userData = useQuery('getUserData');
       return <div>{JSON.stringify(userData)}</div>;
   };
   ```

## Step 6: Test Your Integration

1. **Run Your Application**: Start your application using:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test Authentication**: Ensure that you can sign in and sign up using Clerk.

3. **Test Convex Functions**: Verify that your Convex functions are working as expected.

## Conclusion

You have successfully integrated Convex and Clerk into your React application. Make sure to refer to the official documentation for both services for more advanced features and configurations.
